# Introduction
## Introduction
BIBLIOMAP is a web app built to help university students in Madrid quickly find and reserve library study seats in real time. Instead of wasting time walking to a full library, students can check live availability, pick a time slot and seat type, and confirm a reservation, directly from their phone or laptop. Libraries benefit from smoother demand management and simple usage insights. ATTRIBUTES????

## User Journey 
1. **Access & Preferences:** The student opens the web app, selects a library, desired time window, and optional preferences (quiet area, group table, outlet access).
2. **Availability & Ranking:** BIBLIOMAP fetches **real-time seat availability** and ranks options by fit (time match,), surfacing the **best options first**.
3. **Reserve & Confirm:** The student chooses a seat and confirms; the system **books the seat** and shows confirmation details, with optional email/push **reminders**.
4. **Manage & Iterate:** Users can modify/cancel reservations, join **waitlists**, or tweak preferences and **re-run the search** to get new matches.
5. **Premium (optional):** Students can **upgrade** to unlock premium features (e.g., priority booking windows, multi-slot reservations, advanced filters).

## Why it’s useful

- **Save time:** Know availability before you go.  
- **Peace of mind:** Guaranteed spot with reminders reduces stress.  
- **Better operations:** Libraries use insights to balance demand and improve experience.

## Limitations

- **Library cooperation:** Real libraries may not share data or allow integrations.  
- **Adoption by students:** Even if the system works, habit change can be slow.  
- **Infrastructure limits:** Wi-Fi, server outages, or app-store policies could block usage.
